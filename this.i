# id-law-kit — Intent Tree (this.i)

Shared method and tooling for the identity-law corpus programme = goal:
  id: s62c4j
  why: >
    One place to hold the research method, the corpus/manifest schema, and the fetch-and-cite
    tooling that the per-jurisdiction repos (eu-data-law, eidas-eudi, ccpa, aadhaar, and
    retroactively utah-id-law) all need. Rejected duplicating the tooling per repo, which is what
    utah-id-law does today: the adversarial review of 2026-07-29 found two real defects in its
    sweep patterns, and with four more repos that becomes four more places to fix the same bug.
    Rejected folding this into bakobo/dev, which is cross-cutting *engineering* standards — a legal
    research method and a corpus toolkit would dilute it. The driving constraint is concrete: the
    EUR-Lex fetcher is needed by eu-data-law and eidas-eudi on day one, so the second consumer
    exists before the first line is written. Tradeoff accepted: a package boundary and an extra
    repo to clone, imposed before four consumers have proven the abstraction is right.
  children:
    One repo per regime, not a monorepo = decision:
      id: nljwjw
      why: >
        Chose five sibling repos over a single monorepo. utah-id-law is 34 MB of working tree for
        one US state's three layers; the EU corpus (GDPR consolidated + transposition + EDPB +
        CJEU) is plausibly an order of magnitude larger, and a monorepo makes a reader clone India
        to look at California. The acquisition mechanics share nothing at the fetch layer — EUR-Lex
        content negotiation, a California pubinfo zip, a DSpace handle browse, and a GitHub release
        tag have no common code. Decisively, the redistribution posture differs per corpus and
        utah-id-law's reasoning does not transfer: it rests on "edicts of government, no
        copyright", which is US doctrine, while EU material is © European Union reusable under
        Decision 2011/833/EU with attribution, and Indian government works sit under GODL-India.
        Each repo needs its own LICENSE/NOTICE reasoning, which is cleaner per-repo than as a
        matrix in one README. Tradeoff: cross-jurisdiction findings must cite across sibling
        checkouts by relative path (the ../sedi convention already used by utah-id-law) rather than
        by in-repo path, and five repos must be kept in step by hand.

    The manifest records validity and authority tier, not just provenance = decision:
      id: oxu7ik
      why: >
        utah-id-law's manifest records URL, retrieval date, bytes, SHA-256, and a version stamp —
        enough to prove *what text we fetched and when*, which is all Utah needs because its
        statutes are good law until amended. That is not enough here. Aadhaar Act §57 was struck
        down by the Supreme Court in 2018, yet the Act PDF published on uidai.gov.in still carries
        the text; quote-or-drop over that PDF would *manufacture* a false claim, which is precisely
        the failure the rule exists to prevent. So every corpus item carries `validity`
        (in-force | amended | struck-down | read-down | not-yet-applicable | repealed, with a
        pointer to the instrument that did it) and `authority_tier` (making the trust order that
        sources/registry.md states in prose machine-readable). Rejected leaving this to a prose
        caveat in each README, because a caveat is a thing an agent must remember and this must be
        structural. Tradeoff: `validity` cannot be derived mechanically for most items, so it is
        hand-curated and will lag; a wrong `validity` is more dangerous than an absent one, which
        is why it is a required field with no default rather than an optional annotation.

    cite.py refuses to quote without printing validity = decision:
      id: xrfhyv
      why: >
        The fetcher refuses to write an item with `validity` unset, and cite.py prints the validity
        banner above every quote it emits. Chose enforcement at the two chokepoints over relying on
        the research method doc, because the Aadhaar §57 trap is exactly the kind an agent working
        fast will walk into while believing it is following quote-or-drop. Accepted tradeoff: a
        noisier citation output, and hand-curation becomes a hard blocker on ingest rather than
        something that can be backfilled later.

    Corpus text is English-only, declared rather than assumed = decision:
      id: om6zsj
      why: >
        All 24 EU language versions are equally authentic and the CJEU resolves ambiguity by
        comparing them, so English-only is a real limitation and not a neutral default. Chose to
        take the limitation deliberately and declare it in every EU-derived finding rather than
        archive EN/FR/DE for load-bearing instruments, because the marginal cost is not the fetch
        (one extra call per CELEX) but the analysis — we cannot read a French divergence we do not
        have the competence to weigh, so archiving it would produce false assurance. Tradeoff: any
        finding that turns on a term of art is weaker than it looks, and must say so.

    Layout-only characters are normalised out of stored text = decision:
      id: f5mvj6
      why: >
        EU documents are typeset rather than typed: "Article 22" contains U+00A0 NO-BREAK SPACE
        between the word and the number (232 occurrences in judgment C-634/21 alone), and case
        numbers use U+2011 NON-BREAKING HYPHEN, so a search for "C-311/18" matches nothing. Both
        are invisible on screen, so a sweep returns zero hits and reads as a finding rather than
        as a bug — the same class of defect the utah-id-law adversarial review found in its own
        sweep patterns on 2026-07-29, but harder to see. Chose to normalise these to their plain
        equivalents at extraction, over the purer alternative of storing bytes verbatim and
        normalising in the search layer. Verbatim storage would keep `rg -z` over the raw corpus
        working the way utah-id-law advertises it, and that is a real loss. It was outweighed by
        the failure mode: a false negative in a sweep is silent, and this corpus exists to support
        negative claims ("the law nowhere requires X") that a silent false negative would
        fabricate. The set is deliberately narrow — only characters whose sole function is layout.
        Curly quotes, en dashes, and ellipses are preserved, because they are visible and because
        EU drafting uses the quotes to mark defined terms. Tradeoff: the stored text is not a
        byte-exact copy of what Cellar served, so the manifest's sha256 attests to our extraction
        rather than to the EU's file, and anyone needing the original bytes must refetch.
